The function prints time tables from 1 to 10 sequencely. The second function prints custom time table.


I gave 4 parameters to the function:
-timesTableFrom: which time table we want the sequence to start from
-timesTableUntil: which time table we want the sequence to end at
-multiplyFrom:  the multiplier we want each time table to start from
-multiplyUntil: the multiplier we want each time table to ends at

![Alt text](time_table_1.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

The result will be: 

![Alt text](time_table_2.png?raw=true "Optional Title")
